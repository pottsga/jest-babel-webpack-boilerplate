# Jest Babel Webpack Boilerplate

## Summary

This project's goal is to combine webpack, babel, and jest together into one boilerplate project. This project allows you to use ES6 syntax with Jest, and leverages webpack to utilize Babel in order to transpile and bundle code.

## Directions

1. `cd` into the project.
2. `npm install` the dependencies
3. `npm run dev` to spin up a (webpack) development server
4. `npm run build` to build your code
5. `npm t` to test your code
